            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our mission is to democratize access to personalized education by connecting learners directly with

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Founded in 2023, Windows Learning was born from the recognition that traditional education often lacks the
              personalized attention and real-world expertise that learners need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving
              industries.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our founders, experienced professionals in technology and education, saw the gap between academic learning
              and industry requirements. They created Windows Learning to bridge this gap by facilitating direct
              connections between learners and industry experts.
            </p>
